Webcomics have been, historically, just absolute rubbish at accessibility. Absolute trash.

Part of the problem is there's not an official way that could work. Nobody wants to stick comic transcriptions in `alt`. Not screen-readers, not Google, and definitely not authors.

`longdesc`? Okay, sure, strike a blow for it. We'll just also need something else for, you know, the 99.9% of everyone who can't access it, don't know it's there, or what it means, or has tried it out before and encountered nothing useful.

There are existing solutions: [Ryan North](https://twitter.com/ryanqnorth)'s [OhNoRobot has been crowdsourcing transcripts](http://www.ohnorobot.com/) for years, and all the major WordPress comic plugins that have been ([Comic Easel](http://comiceasel.com/), [ComicPress](http://comicpress.org/), [Webcomic](http://webcomic.nu/)) let authors and/or readers write their own.

These are a good step in the right direction, but they have some ways to go. Too often, the transcripts are buried under lots of other information in the source order, so most users who would need a transcript don't have a good chance of finding it. Some of them are only plain text, which is better than nothing, but not great. And even the markup ones are produced with a WYSIWYG generator, which I would say is worse than just plain text. And OhNoRobot's is hidden in a link to a different domain entirely.
